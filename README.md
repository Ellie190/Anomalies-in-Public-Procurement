# Anomalies-in-Public-Procurement
Data Mining to Identify Anomalies in Public Procurement Rating Parameters

## Project Overview
- Performed Descriptive Analysis on Public Procument Data
- Built an anomaly detection model using the `R` `anomalize` package to detect anomalies in time-series data
- Built a R shiny dashboard with two main functionalities: (1) Descriptive Analysis and (2) anomaly detection on public procurement data
- `Business Science anomalize package:` https://business-science.github.io/anomalize/index.html

## Application Access

## Context 
**Public Procument**
- Public procurement refers to the purchase by governments and state-owned enterprises of goods, services and works.
- The public procurement process is the sequence of activities starting with the assessment of needs through awards to contract management and final payment. <br>

**Bids and Tender**
- Bidding is an offer to set a price tag by an individual or business for a product or service or a demand that something be done. <br>
- A business tender is an offer to do work or supply goods at a fixed price. 
- The tender or bid process is designed to ensure that the work to be done is given out in a fair way

**Anomaly Detection**
- Anomaly detection is the identification of rare items, events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behaviour. 
- Such examples may arouse suspicions of being generated by a different mechanism, or appear inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data. <br>

**Why Anomaly Detection?**
- To detect suspicious activities within the public procument stage that deviate from the usual activities 
- To identify possible/potential fraudulent activities in public procument or in the rewarding of tenders for government goods. 
- For fraud detection in tender awarding and public procurement stages <br>
